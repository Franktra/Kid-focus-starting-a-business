# Legal Aspects for Kids Businesses üìù

Starting a business also involves legal aspects. Here are some that you need to consider:

### 1. Business Structure

Is your business a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation? This [article](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040115/what-difference-between-partnership-corporation-and-sole-proprietorship.asp) explains the difference between them.

### 2. Permits and Licenses

You may need a permit or license to operate your business. Check your local government's website for more information. This [resource](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5-small-business-permits-licenses.html) can also guide you.

### 3. Trademarks, Patents, and Copyrights

If you created a unique product, logo, or name, protect it through a trademark, patent, or copyright. Learn more about them [here](https://www.uspto.gov/).

### 4. Child Labor Laws

Since this is a business for kids, it's important to know the child labor laws in your country. Here's an [article](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/youthlabor/overview) about US child labor laws.

### 5. Taxes
