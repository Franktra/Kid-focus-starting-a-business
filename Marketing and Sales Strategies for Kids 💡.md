Marketing is about understanding your customers and finding ways to provide products or services which they demand.

## Step-by-step guide to developing marketing and sales strategies:

1. **Understand your product**: Knowing what makes your product unique is the first step towards marketing it.

2. **Know your customers**: Research who is likely to use your product. What age are they? What do they like? 

3. **Create a brand**: A brand is not just a logo. It's what people think and feel when they hear about your product.

4. **Advertise**: Use social media, posters, and word of mouth to get the news out about your product.

5. **Sales strategies**: Have a plan for how to sell your product. This might be online, at a local market, or through a store.
